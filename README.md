My first attempt at writing a program in Java.

Program is designed to allow the user to easily count (and record count data) cells/larvae in wells of
culture plates.

Features:
- Set maximum number of cells to count
- Enter number of samples (wells) to be counted
- Enter number of replicates for each sample (well)
- Basic statistics on counts (running average, standard deviation) within replicates and/or across wells.
