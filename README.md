My first attempt at writing a program in Java.

The user should be able to just download and run the .jar file on any platform (currently not tested).  However, the user may have to associate the .jar file type with the Java installation on their system.

Currently, the program is just written in the main method.  Will eventually encapsulate aspects of the program in sub-methods and/or classes.

Program is designed to allow the user to easily count (and record count data) cells/larvae in wells of
culture plates.

Features:
- Set maximum number of cells to count
- Enter number of samples (wells) to be counted
- Enter number of replicates for each sample (well)
- Basic statistics on counts (running average, standard deviation) within replicates and/or across wells.
